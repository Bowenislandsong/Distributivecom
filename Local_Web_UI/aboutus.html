						<h2><span class="primary-text">Claim</span></h2>
						<p>This Project is devoted to class EC 601 as a Distributive Computing software for the public.</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Project Description</h2>
						<p>A cross platform software tool aiming at creating a distributive computing environment for demanding programs. Client either provide computers for helping executing program to obtain credits or propose a program task to distribute amongst available units by paying credits. (Can be substituted by watching commercials.)</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>I am motivated in developing this project because of my interest in distributive system among IoTs, potential finical benefits, and my previous needs for such service. I have previously designed a demanding medical image processing software on MATLAB. The processing time for a simple picture can take up to hours and a complicated high definition picture of cells can take up to days. The cooperation between IoTs is an absolute trend towards smart grid and this project, I believe, will prepare me for my interest. I do acknowledge the difference between distributive system and computing, but I believe distributive computing will help me to study the distributive system model.</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Users and Providers</h2>
						<p>Users are mainly people who are not using their computers for a long period of time and have constant stable Internet access. These users will be interested in providing their computers for this service for credits that can be exchanged to their local currency. In other words, users are people who are interested in signing up their computers for work with fixed amount of salaries depending on their computing powers. The consumers, who will be paying for the service, can execute their program on multiple computers to speed up the program execution process.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Competitors</h2>
						<p>Current leading competitors are BOINC and MATLAB. BOINC only allows well founded super labs be the proposing side while volunteering clients are only motivated for the contribution for big topic science. General public is not allowed to propose a program for the service. MATLAB only supports MATLAB scripted programs.</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Minimum Value Product</h2>
						<p>The Minimum Value Product is the version of a new product with a collection of essential features that satisfy the early users. Our MVP is a User Interface with Low Latency response to Real-Time machine learning and other Iterative tasks.</p>
