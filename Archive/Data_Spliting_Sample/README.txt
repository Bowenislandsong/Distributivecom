\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is an sample python program to split the data\
The functions of the python program are as follows\
1. Identify and unwrap the zip file which consists of two images and one image type changing code\
2. Identify, split and warp two images into two zip files which both have image type changing code\
\
So far, It is assumed that the user shall transmit a zip file called \'93Arc.zip\'94 which has two image \'931.jpg\'94, \'932.jpg\'94 and \'93raytry.py\'94 program. After the data splitting part, the master computer will get \'93data_set_1.zip\'94 and \'93data_set_2.zip\'94. Thus. for the transmission part, It is supposed to transmit those two zip file to two different slave computer}
